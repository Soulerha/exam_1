  <h>Minecon</h><br>Minecon (alternatively capitalised as MineCon, or MINECON) is an annual interactive livestream and fan convention about the video game Minecraft, hosted by Mojang.[1] The first gathering in 2010 was known as MinecraftCon. The event then went by the Minecon name from 2011 to 2019. The Minecon 2011 convention was held in Las Vegas and celebrated the launch of the game with Minecraft-related discussion panels and gaming areas. The most recent in-person convention, Minecon 2016, held in Anaheim, had 12,000 attendees. Since 2017, Minecon has taken the form of an interactive livestream and, as such, Minecon 2016 was the last in-person convention to bear the Minecon name. The livestream was called Minecon Earth in 2017 and 2018, and was later renamed to Minecon Live in 2019 and Minecraft Live starting in 2020.
